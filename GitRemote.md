# Working with git remotly

* Git remote -v (Check the current remote connection)

* Git clone (Clones an existing repo into another place, good for testing without tampering with the "real" repo)

* Git pull (Download content and updates your local repository to match the downloaded)

* Git push (Upload your local repository and commits to a remote one)

* Git remote add "branch" "URL" (Enables devs to work on the same repository by all having remote duplicates, needed for cooperative work on the same repo, in my experience so far)

* Git merge
