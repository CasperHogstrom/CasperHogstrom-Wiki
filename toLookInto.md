### Gitlens
Gitlens is a vs code extension that "supercharges" git within vs code. It looks to help manage commits and makes it easier to see previous changes. I would like to try it since it looks like it might be helpful when working in a team.

### React
A framework I should look into.

### Pinia
Pinia is a store library for Vue, it allows for sharing a state across components/pages. It is possible without Pinia but that exposes your application to security vulnerabilities.
