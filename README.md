## This is my wiki.
In this wiki you will find some of the tools I use, some information on how and why I use them and some more general knowledge every developer should posses. 

A dev should be flexible and not get to attached to a single set of tools but there is nothing wrong with having preferences. My preferences are listed among the basic tools along with a short description of why.  

Git is a big part of my workflow so it has a big part in this wiki atm. There is information on working with git locally as git is local, but it also has a big part to play when working remotely. So there is a part about that too.
