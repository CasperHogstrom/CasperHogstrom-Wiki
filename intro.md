## Things needed for development:
* Webbrowser/Webläsare ( Needed for research testing. Edge & Chrome i'm used to it and is good for testing)

* Code editor/Kod editor ( To write code. Visual Studio Code pref atm. what im used to and know how to navigate and install extensions )

* Source control manager/Käll kontroll hantering(Documentation, backups and github integration. Git I'm used to it and know the basics)

* Runtime (Can't make everything yourself. Node.js. I'm used to it, it is widely used(easy to reaserch) has integration with alot of other useful stuff)

* Software registry/Mjukvaru bilbilotek (For getting packets and others smart solutions. Npm Since it is the worlds largest and most widely used)

* Software management automation (Ease of installation, no need for searching the internet it solves that for you. Chocolately Ease of use and it is an optional install when installing node.js)

* Extensions (For relevant intellicense and other framework use cases, but also for more comfort or personalization. I use a few but for just looks and some for getting the right intellicense)



## Setting up an SSH for an easier and safer connection to Github
It works through a private key file stored locally on your pc. Its purpose is to increase safety and workflow efficency. Instead of always needing to authenticate you by throwing a prompt where you have to login Github can instead use the SSH to verify your PC.
